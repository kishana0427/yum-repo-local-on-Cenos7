How to setup local yum server with file:/// option:
==================================================

To set up a local YUM server that can be accessed using the file:/// protocol, you'll need to create a repository on a local machine or server that holds your RPM packages. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set it up:
1. Prepare the RPM Files

First, you need to have a collection of RPM files that you want to serve via the local YUM server. You can either use the RPM packages you have downloaded, or you can create your own repository from installed packages using the createrepo tool.
2. Install Required Packages

You need to install the necessary packages to create and serve the local repository. You will need createrepo for creating the repository metadata. If createrepo is not already installed, use the following command:

sudo yum install createrepo

3. Create the Directory for the Repository

Create a directory to store the RPM files and the repository metadata. For example:

sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/repo

4. Copy RPM Files to the Repository Directory

Copy all the RPM files you want to include in your local YUM repository to this directory. For example:

sudo cp /path/to/rpms/*.rpm /var/www/html/repo/

5. Generate Repository Metadata

After copying the RPM files to the repository directory, you need to generate repository metadata using createrepo. Run the following command in the repository directory:

sudo createrepo /var/www/html/repo/

This will generate metadata such as repodata/ which YUM uses to know about the available packages and dependencies.
6. Configure HTTP Server (Optional)

If you want the repository to be accessible over HTTP, you'll need a web server (like Apache or Nginx). Assuming you're using Apache, make sure it's installed and running:

sudo yum install httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

Ensure the web server is serving the repository directory. This should already be set up if your repository is in /var/www/html/, but verify the web server configuration if needed.

sudo systemctl restart httpd

7. Create the YUM Repo File on Client Machines

On the client machine where you want to use the local YUM server, you need to create a YUM repository file pointing to the local repository. This file will tell YUM how to find your local repository.

Create a .repo file in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. For example, create a file named local.repo:

sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo

Add the following content to the file, adjusting the path as necessary:

[local-repo]
name=Local YUM Repository
baseurl=file:///var/www/html/repo/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

    baseurl=file:///var/www/html/repo/ points to your local repository.
    enabled=1 means the repository is enabled.
    gpgcheck=0 can be set to 1 if you are using GPG signing for your RPMs, but for local repositories, it's usually set to 0.

8. Clean YUM Cache and Test the Repository

Run the following command to clean up the YUM cache and refresh the repository metadata:

sudo yum clean all
sudo yum repolist

You should now see your local repository listed in the output.
9. Use the Local Repository

You can now install packages from your local repository using the following command:

sudo yum install <package-name>

If you want to use the repository over HTTP rather than the file:/// protocol, the configuration would look like:

[local-repo]
name=Local YUM Repository
baseurl=http://<server-ip-or-domain>/repo/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

That’s it! You've now set up a local YUM server using the file:/// option for local access.

how to run this sudo yum install createrepo with rpm
ChatGPT said:

If you'd like to install createrepo from an RPM file rather than using yum, you'll need to manually download the createrepo RPM package, then install it using the rpm command. Here’s how to do it step-by-step:
1. Download the createrepo RPM Package

First, you need to download the createrepo RPM package. You can find it from a reliable source like CentOS or Fedora repositories, or you can use a direct download link.

You can find the appropriate createrepo RPM for your system (e.g., for CentOS or RHEL, for your architecture) by searching for it online or using the following command (adjust for your needs):

wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/createrepo-0.10.3-8.el7.x86_64.rpm

Make sure to download the correct version of createrepo that matches your system architecture.
2. Install the RPM File Using the rpm Command

After downloading the RPM file, you can install it using the rpm command. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the createrepo RPM file and run:

sudo rpm -ivh createrepo-0.10.3-8.el7.x86_64.rpm

Replace the filename with the correct version of the RPM you downloaded.

The -ivh flags mean:

    i for install
    v for verbose output
    h for progress indicator during installation

3. Verify the Installation

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that createrepo is installed correctly by running:

createrepo --version

This should show you the version of createrepo that was installed.
4. Use createrepo to Create Your Local Repository

Now that you have createrepo installed, you can proceed with setting up your local repository by following the steps mentioned earlier.
Troubleshooting

    If you encounter missing dependencies while installing the RPM file, you can download and install them manually using rpm in the same way, or resolve the dependencies using yum if your system still has internet access.

and i want to disable online repo
ChatGPT said:

To disable online repositories on your system and only use the local repository (or others that you configure), you can either disable each online repository individually or disable all repositories globally.

Here are the steps to disable online repositories:
Option 1: Disable Online Repositories (Individually)

    Locate the Repository Files

    The repository configuration files are stored in /etc/yum.repos.d/. Each .repo file corresponds to a repository (e.g., CentOS-Base.repo, epel.repo, etc.).

    List the .repo files in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory:

ls /etc/yum.repos.d/

Edit the Online Repository Configuration Files

You will need to edit the .repo files that are pointing to online repositories. For example, the CentOS or RHEL base repositories may be in files like CentOS-Base.repo.

Open each file using a text editor like nano or vi:

sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo

Disable the Online Repositories

In each .repo file, you can disable the repositories by setting enabled=0 for each online repository entry. For example:

    [base]
    name=CentOS-7 - Base
    baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/
    enabled=0
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7

    [updates]
    name=CentOS-7 - Updates
    baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/
    enabled=0
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7

    Change enabled=1 to enabled=0 for each repository section you want to disable.

    Save the File

    After making changes, save and exit the file (Ctrl + X in nano, then press Y to confirm changes and Enter to save).

    Repeat for Other Online Repositories

    Go through other .repo files (like epel.repo, extras.repo, etc.) and disable all online repositories in the same manner.

Option 2: Disable All Online Repositories (Globally)

If you want to disable all online repositories in one go (but still be able to keep your local repo active), you can globally disable all online repositories by editing the /etc/yum.conf file.

    Edit the yum.conf File

    Open the /etc/yum.conf file with a text editor:

sudo nano /etc/yum.conf

Add/Modify the enabled Setting

Add or modify the following lines to disable online repositories globally:

[main]
plugins=1
enabled=0

This will disable all repositories by default.

Enable Local Repository

Now, enable your local repository in the .repo file you created earlier (e.g., local.repo):

    [local-repo]
    name=Local YUM Repository
    baseurl=file:///var/www/html/repo/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

Option 3: Temporarily Disable Online Repositories Using the --disablerepo Option

If you just want to temporarily disable online repositories for a single yum operation, you can use the --disablerepo option.

For example, to disable all repositories except for your local one, run:

sudo yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="local-repo" install <package-name>

This command tells yum to disable all repositories (--disablerepo="*") except for local-repo (--enablerepo="local-repo").
Verify the Changes

After disabling the online repositories, you can check which repositories are enabled:

sudo yum repolist

This will show only the repositories that are enabled (e.g., your local repository) and verify that online repositories are disabled.

By following these steps, you’ll have a system that only uses your local YUM repository and doesn't access online repositories.
